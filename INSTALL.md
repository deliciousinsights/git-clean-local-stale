# Installing `git-clean-stale-local`

Just grab the `git-clean-stale-local` file and put it somewhere in your PATH (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`), then make sure it's executable (`chmod +x path-to-the-file`).

It should then appear within your usual Git completion (so you could type `git clean-stale-local`) and work just fine.

This assumes a Bash-compatible system (Git Bash on Windows, for instance, and any shell on Linux/OSX).
